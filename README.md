The code contains the implementation of Fidducia Mattheyses algorithm for Bipartitioning a hyper graph.
There exists a document that reflects the algorithm, and the results for each hypergraph.
The various files includes, netlist and the corresponding results generated by the utility.
The quality of implementation is judged by the runtime to partition the nodes/edges with minimum cut while ensuring the balance is close to 0.5
